# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

 The Corner Grocer project determines the frequency at which each item contained in the input text file occurs, then enables the user to request the frequency of a particular item, print a table of all item frequencies, or print a histogram of all item frequencies. The program populates a Map of the items and their frequencies, then saves that data to the file frequency.dat.

# What did you do particularly well?

 I quite like the work done on highlighting certain bits of text, by using a special unicode character + color, I was able to create the appearance of a solid bar for use in the histogram. This may see reuse later, for a progress bar or something similar.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

 The program could certainly use some further enhancement in terms of input validation, with a particular focus on identifying addtional edge cases that may cause unpredictable behavior. This journal submission will almost certainly see addtional work during my program.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

The most challenging aspect of the project was the implementation of the Map, as this was the first time I have used a Map in C++. I was able to use the course materials as well as some quick reference material from [cplusplus.com/](https://cplusplus.com/reference/map/map/)

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

 I will most certainly continue using C++ through both my Computer Science and Game Programming and Development programs (Dual Degree), so in a sense all aspects of the project will carry forward with me into future projects. 

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

 In order to keep the program maintainable, readable, and adaptable I adhered to industry standard best practices, as demonstrated through this course and others.
