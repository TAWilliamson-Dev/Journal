# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
# What did you do particularly well?
# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

# The Corner Grocer project determines the frequency at which each item contained in the input text file occurs, then enables the user to request the frequency of 
# a particular item, print a table of all item frequencies, or print a histogram of all item frequencies. The program populates a Map of the items and their frequencies,
# then saves that data to the file frequency.dat.

# I quite like the work done on highlighting certain bits of text, by using a special unicode character + color, I was able to create the appearance of a solid bar for use in the histogram.
# This may see reuse later, for a progress bar or something similar.

# The most challenging aspect of the project was the implementation of the Map, as this was the first time I have used a Map in C++. I was able to use the course materials as well as some quick
# reference material from [cplusplus.com/](https://cplusplus.com/reference/map/map/)

# I will most certainly continue using C++ through both my Computer Science and Game Programming and Development programs (Dual Degree), so in a sense all aspects of the project will carry forward with me
# into future projects. 

# In order to keep the program maintainable, readable, and adaptable I adhered to industry standard best practices, as demonstrated through this course and others.
